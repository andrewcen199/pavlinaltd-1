              The first feature film produced by Pavlina Ltd. in 1987 was{" "}
              <span className="fst-italic">The Magic Snowman</span>, a live
              action children's fairy tale starring Roger Moore as the voice of
              the Magic Snowman. The film's gross receipts to date are ten times
              the original low-budget cost. Distributed through Miramax/Buena
              Vista International it has been seen by twenty million children in
              the United States.

            <p className="mb-2 mb-xl-2">
              The second feature produced in 1992 was the supernatural thriller
              <span className="fst-italic">Happy Hell Night</span>, starring
              Darren McGavin. The film was distributed worldwide by several
              international distributors and released on DVD by AnchorBay

              To ensure a successful distribution life and minimize investment
              risks, the company focuses on development and production of
              perennial stories. In keeping with such business strategy, over
              the past ten years the company has financed the acquisition and
              development of several children's properties.

            <p>
              The company's strength is the original content of the stories it
              develops and produced and while through its feature films it
              offers popular entertainment, the documentaries celebrate people
              whose lives have left an imprint on the human experience.
